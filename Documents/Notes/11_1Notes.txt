Meeting 11/1 : Game Plan

Step 1 : Environment Setup

A basic environment consists of 
 - contact points (vertices from which different methods of transportation will go between)
 - roads (edges how buses travel)
 - atmosphere (2D or 3D space how a plane travels)

Additional environmental conditions we can add later on
 - Bike lanes, water, bridges, traffic conditions, elevation, weather related obstacles

Major Goal
 - GUI of environment


Step 2 : Add Agents to the Environment

Our basic agents 
 - bus 
 - plane

Other possible agents can be 
 - bike, boat, train (dependent on environment)

The different modes of transportation are agents because of the specific way each interacts with their environment. Additionally, they each have different actions and rules associated with them.
Each will also have a specific performance measure which will consider time or ticket price. We will use this performance measure when using A* search in order to find paths.
