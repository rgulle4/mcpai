When calculating the time heuristic need to choose between flying and driving speeds. We'll choose flying because it is more optimistic.

- Cost

Sometimes a plane could be cheaper than driving if there is a special.
Price per gallon for driving and plane ticket for flying

- Stops along path?
Will just be a search to the stop then a search to the goal
